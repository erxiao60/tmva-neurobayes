This Plugin was developed for use with TMVA included in ROOT-5.24 and later.
For ROOT-5.18 till 5.22 please use the older one.

At the time being, the plugin won't be usable without adding the file 
addinMethod/MethodPlugins.cxx into <yourroot_folder>/tmva/src and recompiling.
(This is needed in order to register the pluginhandler as a constructor in the 
TMVA-Factory.)

Afterwards compiling and installing of this plugin is done in these steps:

1. It is assumed you have ROOT and NeuroBayes installed, you have added MethodPlugins.cxx 
   into the tmva/src folder as described above and ran 'make' again in the ROOT folder.
   So make sure you have setup your environment
	export ROOTSYS=<your path to root sources>
	export NEUROBAYES=<your Path to NeuroBayes>
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$NEUROBAYES/lib:$ROOTSYS/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

2. In your NeuroBayesTMVAPlugin folder run "make"
3. (Optionally) If the above step went fine run "make install" which will copy 
   the generated library to the ROOTSYS/lib folder (makes only sense if you have write access
   to the ROOT-folder of cause). However one can also just add the plugins folder to
   the LD_LIBRARY_PATH, which should also work fine.

To actually use the plugin ROOT must be told how to use it. This is simply done
with an .rootrc file in the folder where your TMVA macro resides. It has to contain
the following two lines.
Plugin.TMVA@@MethodBase: .*_NeuroBayes.*     TMVA::MethodNeuroBayes TMVANeuroBayes "MethodNeuroBayes(DataSetInfo&,TString)"
+Plugin.TMVA@@MethodBase:  .*NeuroBayes.* TMVA::MethodNeuroBayes TMVANeuroBayes "MethodNeuroBayes(TString&,TString&,DataSetInfo&,TString&)"

(NOTE: this has changed compared to the older version of the plugin!)

An example .rootrc file is shipped with this package.
