This Plugin was developed for use with TMVA included in ROOT-5.24 and later.
For ROOT-5.18 till 5.22 please use the older one.

Installation:

1. It is assumed you have ROOT and NeuroBayes installed. So make sure you have setup your environment
	export ROOTSYS=<your path to root sources>
	export NEUROBAYES=<your Path to NeuroBayes>
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$NEUROBAYES/lib:$ROOTSYS/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

2. In your NeuroBayesTMVAPlugin folder run "make"

3. (Optionally) If the above step went fine run "make install" which will copy 
   the generated library to the ROOTSYS/lib folder (makes only sense if you have write access
   to the ROOT-folder of cause). However one can also just add the plugins folder to
   the LD_LIBRARY_PATH, which should also work fine.

In case of errors or bugs concerning the plugin, please file a ticket at neurobayes.phi-t.de
